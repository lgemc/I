# Week 8: Week 8: Midterm Project

Introduction:
Welcome to week 8, where we will be applying all the concepts and techniques we have learned so far into a comprehensive midterm project. This project will focus on image processing and classification using deep learning. It's an opportunity to put your knowledge into practice and gain hands-on experience in the field of image processing and deep learning. 

Key Concepts:
The midterm project will be anchored on the following key concepts:
1. Basic Python for Image Processing: You will need to apply the Python programming skills acquired in week 2, such as using different libraries for image manipulation and processing.
2. Neural Networks: You will implement and train neural networks for image classification as learned in week 3.
3. Image Processing Techniques: Techniques learned in week 4, like image enhancement, segmentation, and transformations, will be used to preprocess the images for the neural network.
4. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs): You will create a CNN model, as learned in week 5, to classify the images based on their features.
5. Deep Learning Models: You will use deep learning models for image classification, modeled on the lessons from week 6.
6. Image Segmentation: You will apply deep learning techniques for image segmentation, as learned in week 7.

Examples:
For example, you might be given a dataset of dog images and asked to develop a model that can accurately classify the breed of the dog. This would involve loading and preprocessing the images using Python, using image processing techniques to enhance and segment the images, developing a neural network model, and finally training and testing the model using the image data.

Exercises:
1. Dataset Selection: Choose a dataset that you will use for the project. It could be a dataset provided by us or one you have found interesting. Make sure it has enough images for training and testing the model.
2. Image Preprocessing: Use the image processing techniques learned in week 4 to prepare your images for the neural network.
3. Model Development: Develop a CNN model and use the deep learning techniques learned so far to train the model on your dataset.
4. Model Testing: Test the performance of your model on a set of unseen images. Evaluate its performance using metrics such as accuracy, recall, precision, and F1 score.
5. Report Writing: Write a report on your project detailing the steps you took, any challenges you faced, how you overcame them, and the performance of your model.

This week's midterm project will help cement your understanding of the material covered so far. It also provides a practical experience that mirrors real-world tasks and challenges in the field of image processing and deep learning. We are excited to see what you will create!
