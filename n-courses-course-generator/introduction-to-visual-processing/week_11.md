Week 11: Object Detection using Deep Learning

Introduction:
Object detection is a computer vision technique that allows us to identify and locate objects in an image or video. It's not just about classifying a single object, but potentially several objects within the same image, and also specifying where in the image they are located. This week, we will explore how Deep Learning models can be used for object detection tasks. This builds directly on the concepts we have learned so far, including image processing, neural networks, and convolutional neural networks.

Key Concepts:
1. Object Detection: This involves recognizing instances of an object category (like 'car', 'person', 'dog') in an image and providing the spatial location and extent of each instance. Object detection is a crucial step for many computer vision applications like autonomous driving, video surveillance, etc.

2. Bounding Box: A bounding box is a rectangle that can be determined by the x and y location of the object within an image, as well as the width and height of the object.

3. Region Proposal Networks (RPNs): These generate a set of potential bounding boxes in an image. They are a type of convolutional neural network used to detect the object and its boundary within the image.

4. Intersection over Union (IoU): This is a measure of the overlap between two bounding boxes. It is used to evaluate the accuracy of the object detection model.

5. Non-Max Suppression: A technique used to keep the best bounding box after the object detection model has proposed several for the same object.

Examples:
Several Deep Learning models have been used for object detection tasks. These include:

1. R-CNN: The Regions with CNN features model (R-CNN) uses a search algorithm to extract a set of object proposals, and then a CNN to classify each proposal. The model then applies a bounding box regressor to improve the localization.

2. Fast R-CNN: This model improves the R-CNN by extracting the image features first, and then passing the region proposals to the CNN. This reduces the computational cost.

3. Faster R-CNN: It further improves the model by replacing the search algorithm with a region proposal network, reducing the number of proposals and improving the speed.

4. YOLO (You Only Look Once): This model applies a single neural network to the full image, dividing the image into regions and predicting bounding boxes and probabilities for each region.

Exercises:
1. Implement a basic object detection model using a pre-trained CNN.
2. Experiment with different region proposal methods and observe their impact on the speed and accuracy of the object detection.
3. Use Non-Max Suppression to improve the results of your object detection model.
4. Implement and compare the performance of different object detection models like R-CNN, Fast R-CNN, Faster R-CNN, and YOLO.

By the end of this week, students should be comfortable with the basics of object detection using deep learning and be able to implement and evaluate different object detection models. This knowledge will be beneficial in the upcoming topics, such as Deep Learning for Video Processing and Generative Adversarial Networks.
