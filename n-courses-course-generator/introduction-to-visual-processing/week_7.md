Week 7: Image Segmentation using Deep Learning

Introduction

Building upon the knowledge gained in the previous weeks of this course, Week 7 dives into the exciting realm of Image Segmentation using Deep Learning. Image segmentation is a critical process in image processing and computer vision that involves partitioning an image into multiple segments or sets of pixels. The goal is to simplify or change the representation of an image into something more meaningful and easier to analyze.

Image segmentation is widely used in various fields such as medical imaging, autonomous driving, and surveillance systems. With the power of deep learning techniques, more precise and efficient segmentation is possible.

Key Concepts

1. Image Segmentation: It involves partitioning an image into different segments where each segment comprises a group of pixels with similar attributes. Two major types of image segmentation are semantic segmentation (classifying each pixel into a class) and instance segmentation (differentiating instances of the same class).

2. Deep Learning for Image Segmentation: Deep learning models, especially convolutional neural networks (CNNs), have been extensively used for image segmentation. They can learn hierarchical features automatically from data and have shown remarkable performance in this task.

3. Popular Deep Learning Models for Image Segmentation: Some popular models are U-Net, SegNet, and Mask R-CNN. U-Net is especially known for its effectiveness in biomedical image segmentation.

Examples

In this week, we will delve into the implementation of these models. For instance, we will use U-Net, a convolutional network for biomedical image segmentation to segment images of cells. We will train this model using Python and the deep learning library, Keras. We will also use pre-trained models like VGG16 as a part of our segmentation model to understand the concept of transfer learning.

Exercises

1. Implement U-Net using Keras: This exercise will help you understand the architecture of U-Net and how to implement it using Keras.

2. Use a pre-trained model for Image Segmentation: Try using a pre-trained model like VGG16 for image segmentation. Understand how transfer learning can be leveraged in segmentation tasks.

3. Evaluate your segmentation model: Learn to use metrics like Intersection over Union (IoU) and Dice coefficient for evaluating your segmentation models.

By the end of this week, you will have a practical understanding of how deep learning can be used for image segmentation. This will set the stage for next weekâ€™s topic, where we will be working on a midterm project, applying the concepts learned so far.
