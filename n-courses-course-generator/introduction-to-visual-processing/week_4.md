Week 4: Image Processing Techniques

Introduction:

After having a basic understanding of Image Processing and Deep Learning from Week 1, getting familiarized with Python for Image Processing in Week 2, and an Introduction to Neural Networks in Week 3, we are now ready to delve into more specific techniques used in Image Processing. This week, we will be focusing on detailed exploration of various image processing techniques including image enhancement, edge detection, segmentation, and morphological operations.

Key Concepts:

1. Image Enhancement: This technique is used to accentuate certain features or to remove noise from an image. It can be achieved through various methods like histogram equalization, contrast stretching, and noise removal techniques.

2. Edge Detection: Edge detection is a fundamental tool used in most image processing applications to obtain information from the frames as a precursor step to feature extraction and object segmentation. This technique helps in finding the boundaries or contours of objects within an image.

3. Image Segmentation: This technique is used to partition an image into multiple segments or sets of pixels, also known as superpixels. The goal of segmentation is to simplify or change the representation of an image into something more meaningful and easier to analyze.

4. Morphological Operations: In image processing, morphological operations are used to process an image based on its shape. This method uses a structuring element for the operations like erosion, dilation, opening, and closing.

Examples:

1. Image Enhancement: Enhancing a dark image to view the objects clearly.
2. Edge Detection: Detecting the edges of buildings in a cityscape image.
3. Image Segmentation: Segmenting an image to identify and isolate specific objects such as cars, people, etc.
4. Morphological Operations: Removing noise from an image using erosion followed by dilation.

Exercises:

1. Implement image enhancement techniques on a low-contrast image and observe the results.
2. Use an edge detection algorithm like Sobel, or Canny to find edges in an image.
3. Segment a complex image into its component objects.
4. Perform morphological operations on an image to remove noise.

In the following weeks, we will explore how these techniques are used in the context of Convolutional Neural Networks (Week 5), Deep Learning Models for Image Classification (Week 6), and Image Segmentation using Deep Learning (Week 7). This week's content lays the foundation for understanding more complex image processing techniques that will be covered in later weeks.
