Week 5: Convolutional Neural Networks

Introduction

Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are a class of deep learning models primarily used for image processing tasks. They are designed to automatically and adaptively learn spatial hierarchies of features from images, which is a key advantage over traditional, hand-engineered image processing techniques. By building on the content covered in previous weeks, including the basics of Python for image processing and introductory principles of neural networks, we are now ready to delve into the specifics of CNNs and their role in advanced image processing.

Key Concepts

1. Structure of a CNN: A CNN is composed of one or more convolutional layers, optionally followed by pooling layers, fully connected layers, and normalization layers. The convolutional layer performs a convolution operation on the input, passing the result to the next layer. The pooling layer reduces the spatial size of the representation, reducing the amount of parameters and computation in the network. The fully connected layer connects every neuron in one layer to every neuron in another layer.

2. Convolution Operation: This is a mathematical operation that takes two inputs, an image matrix and a filter or kernel, and outputs a feature map. It involves element-wise multiplication of the kernel with the image matrix, summing them up and then adding a bias term.

3. Feature Learning: CNNs have the ability to learn features automatically without the need for manual feature extraction. The features are learned by training a model on a large dataset.

Examples

An example of a CNN is the LeNet-5 network, which was used to read zip code digits on mail envelopes. It consists of two sets of convolutional and average pooling layers, followed by a flattening convolutional layer, then two fully-connected layers and finally a softmax classifier.

Another example is the AlexNet, which won the 2012 ImageNet Large-Scale Visual Recognition Challenge (ILSVRC). It features five convolutional layers, followed by three fully connected layers and a 1000-way softmax.

Exercises

1. Implement a simple CNN: Use a deep learning library such as TensorFlow or PyTorch to implement a simple CNN for an image classification task. You can use the MNIST dataset, which is a set of 70,000 small images of digits handwritten by high school students and employees of the US Census Bureau.

2. Experiment with different CNN architectures: Try adding more convolutional layers, or changing the size of the filters in the convolutional layers. Observe how these changes affect the accuracy and training time of your network.

3. Visualize the learned filters: After training the CNN, visualize the filters in the convolutional layers. This can give you some insight into what features the network is learning.

By the end of this week, you should have a solid understanding of how CNNs work and how they are used in image processing. This knowledge will be built upon in the following weeks as we explore more advanced topics such as deep learning models for image classification, image segmentation using deep learning, and more.
