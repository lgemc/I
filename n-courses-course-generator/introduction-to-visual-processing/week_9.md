Week 9: Advanced Image Processing Techniques

Introduction

Welcome to Week 9! After learning about basic image processing techniques and a variety of deep learning models for image classification and segmentation, we are now ready to delve into more advanced image processing techniques. In this week, we will explore powerful techniques such as image restoration, image transformation, and the application of deep learning in these techniques.

Key Concepts

1. Image Restoration: This advanced technique aims to improve an image that has been degraded by noise, blurring, or distortion. We will discuss various methods, such as Wiener filtering and Inverse filtering.

2. Image Transformation: We will learn about various transformations like Fourier, Discrete Cosine, and Haar, which can provide different perspectives of an image, aiding in the extraction of useful features.

3. Deep Learning in Advanced Image Processing: We will explore how deep learning can be applied to these advanced techniques. We will learn about autoencoders for image denoising, and deep learning-based super-resolution techniques for enhancing image resolution.

Examples

1. Image Restoration: We will use the concept of Wiener filtering to restore a blurred and noisy image.

2. Image Transformation: We will apply Fourier Transformation on an image and interpret the frequency components.

3. Deep Learning in Advanced Image Processing: We will use a deep learning model to enhance the resolution of an image using super-resolution techniques.

Exercises

1. Use Inverse filtering to restore an image that has been blurred by a known low-pass filter.

2. Apply the Discrete Cosine Transformation on an image and interpret the results.

3. Implement an autoencoder to denoise an image. Compare the results with traditional denoising techniques.

Summary

This week, we delved into advanced image processing techniques, specifically focusing on image restoration and transformation. We also discovered how deep learning can further enhance these advanced techniques. With the theoretical understanding and practical exercises, you should now have a profound understanding of these advanced techniques and how they can be used to solve complex image processing tasks.

As we move forward to Week 10, we will explore the concept of Transfer Learning in Image Processing. This will allow us to utilize pre-trained models to improve the efficiency and performance of our image processing tasks. Remember that the advanced techniques we learned this week can be instrumental when dealing with complex real-world image processing problems.
