Week 11: B1 Grammar - Direct and Indirect Speech

Introduction:
Welcome to Week 11 of our B1 Grammar course! This week, we're delving into an essential aspect of English language usage: Direct and Indirect Speech. Understanding the difference between these two forms of speech and knowing how to use them correctly is vital for clear, effective communication. These concepts often appear in conversations, story-telling, reports, and other forms of writing. 

Key Concepts:

1. Direct Speech: Direct speech refers to the exact words someone has said. It is often enclosed in quotation marks. For example, He said, "I will go to the party tonight."

2. Indirect Speech: Also known as reported speech, indirect speech conveys the same information as direct speech but without quoting someone's exact words. The tense usually changes in reported speech. For example, He said that he would go to the party that night.

Examples:

Direct Speech: She said, "I love playing basketball."
Indirect Speech: She said that she loved playing basketball.

Direct Speech: "I am tired," he complained.
Indirect Speech: He complained that he was tired.

Direct Speech: "I will finish my homework before dinner," Sarah promised.
Indirect Speech: Sarah promised that she would finish her homework before dinner.

1. "I am studying for my exams," said John.
2. Mary said, "I am going to the market."
3. "We will visit the museum tomorrow," they announced.
