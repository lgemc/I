Tenses are crucial for conveying when events happen in English, and mastering them is essential for fluency. This week, we will review all the tenses we've learnt so far, from simple past to perfect progressive.

   - Simple Present (I speak)

   - Present Perfect (I have spoken)
   - Past Perfect (I had spoken)
