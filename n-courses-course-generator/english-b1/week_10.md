Title: Week 10: B1 Speaking - Conversation Skills

Introduction:
Welcome to Week 10 of our course! This week, we delve into the heart of B1 Speaking skills – Conversation Skills. As we all know, conversation is the lifeblood of language. It is an essential skill that helps us connect with others, express our thoughts, and understand diverse perspectives. In this week's module, we focus on honing your conversation skills in English to help you confidently engage in dialogues, debates, discussions, and casual chats.

Key Concepts:

1. Active Listening: The first step in any conversation is to listen actively. It involves understanding, responding, and remembering what is being said. Conversely, it gives the speaker a sense of being heard and understood.

2. Clarity and Conciseness: For effective conversation, your ideas should be expressed clearly and concisely. Avoid unnecessary jargon and lengthy sentences. 

3. Use of Open-Ended Questions: Open-ended questions stimulate discussion and allow the speaker to express their thoughts freely. These are questions that cannot be answered with a simple 'yes' or 'no'. 

4. Polite Disagreement: It's okay to disagree in a conversation, but it's important to do it politely. Use phrases like 'I see your point, but..' or 'That's an interesting perspective, however..'

5. Use of Fillers: In natural conversation, fillers such as 'um', 'like', 'you know' are used. They give you extra time to think about what you want to say next.

Examples:

1. Active Listening: "I see, you went for a trip last weekend. How was your experience?"

2. Clarity and Conciseness: Instead of saying, "I am of the opinion that the movie I saw last night was not up to my expectations," say, "I didn't like the movie I saw last night."

3. Use of Open-Ended Questions: Instead of asking, "Did you enjoy the concert?", ask "What did you enjoy most about the concert?"

4. Polite Disagreement: "I understand where you're coming from, but I believe that every individual has a unique perspective."

5. Use of Fillers: "I think I would, um, like to order the Caesar salad.”

Exercises:

1. Active Listening Exercise: Listen to a 5-minute podcast or news clip. Try to summarise the main points afterward. For an added challenge, try to remember specific details or facts mentioned.

2. Clarity and Conciseness Exercise: Choose a complex topic and try to explain it in a simple and concise manner to a friend or family member.

3. Open-Ended Questions Exercise: Write down 10 open-ended questions that you could use in a conversation with a friend.

4. Polite Disagreement Exercise: Think of a topic you strongly disagree with and practice expressing your disagreement politely.

5. Use of Fillers Exercise: Record a 1-minute monologue about your day. Listen back and take note of the fillers you naturally use.

Remember, conversation is an art that improves with practice. So, don't forget to practice these skills in your daily conversations!
